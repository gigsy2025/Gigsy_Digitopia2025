# Deployment Guide

## At a Glance

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the deployment process for the Gigsy MVP. It covers everything from local development to production deployment, including CI/CD, security, and monitoring.

## Deployment Strategy

The Gigsy MVP uses a container-based deployment strategy with Docker. All deployments are immutable, meaning that a new container is built for each new version of the application. This ensures that the application is always in a known state and that deployments are repeatable.

### Environments

- **Development**: Used for feature testing and integration validation. Automatically deploys from the `master` branch.
- **Production**: The live, user-facing application. Automatically deploys from the `main` branch with approval gates.

### CI/CD

The CI/CD pipeline is managed by GitHub Actions. The pipeline is responsible for:

- Building the Docker image.
- Running tests.
- Scanning for security vulnerabilities.
- Deploying the application to the appropriate environment.

## Getting Started

### Local Development

1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone https://github.com/gigsy2025/Gigsy_Digitopia2025.git`
2. **Install dependencies**: `pnpm install`
3. **Start the development server**: `pnpm run dev`

### Docker

1. **Build the Docker image**: `docker build -t gigsy .`
2. **Run the Docker container**: `docker run -p 3000:3000 gigsy`

## Production Deployment

Production deployments are handled automatically by the CI/CD pipeline. When a pull request is merged into the `main` branch, a new Docker image is built and deployed to the production environment.

### Rollbacks

If a deployment fails, it can be rolled back to a previous version by redeploying a previous Docker image.

## Security

Security is a top priority for the Gigsy MVP. The CI/CD pipeline includes a number of security checks, including:

- **Dependency scanning**: To identify and patch vulnerable dependencies.
- **Container scanning**: To identify and patch vulnerabilities in the Docker image.
- **Static analysis**: To identify and patch security vulnerabilities in the source code.

## Monitoring

The Gigsy MVP is monitored using a variety of tools, including:

- **Health checks**: To ensure that the application is running correctly.
- **Performance monitoring**: To identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
- **Error tracking**: To identify and resolve application errors.
