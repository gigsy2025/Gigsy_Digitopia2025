Imagine you are a Principal Engineer and Read and Understand How Jotai Works from their Official Documentation: https://jotai.org/docs/ and then apply that knowledge to the code edits below.
Now, make the necessary code edits to integrate Jotai state management into the existing codebase. Ensure that the integration is seamless and follows best practices for using Jotai in a React/ Next.js application. Pay attention to the structure of atoms, providers, and how state is accessed and modified within components. Your goal is to enhance the application's state management capabilities using Jotai while maintaining code readability, performance, Scalability, Maintainability, TypeSafety and SOLID Principles.
