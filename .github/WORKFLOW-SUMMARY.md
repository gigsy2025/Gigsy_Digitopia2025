# ðŸš€ Updated Full Pipeline CI/CD Workflow

## What Changed

Your GitHub Actions workflow now runs the **complete full pipeline** for both pull requests and pushes to main/master branches. Every trigger gets the complete treatment: unit tests, build, scan, and publish to DockerHub.

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests with Jest (Current Implementation)

For Gigsy's distributed system, we're starting with **unit tests** as the foundation:

âœ… **Jest Unit Testing Framework**

- Component unit tests (React Testing Library)
- Business logic unit tests (utility functions, calculations)
- TypeScript integration with full type checking
- Code coverage reporting and tracking
- Fast feedback loop (runs in ~30-60 seconds)

### Future Testing Expansion (Recommended)

As the system grows, consider adding:

ðŸ”„ **Integration Tests** (Next Phase)

- API endpoint testing
- Database integration testing
- Service-to-service communication testing

ðŸ”„ **End-to-End Tests** (Final Phase)

- Full user workflow testing
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance regression testing

## Workflow Behavior

### On Pull Request to Main/Master

âœ… **Full Pipeline Runs:**

- **Unit tests with Jest** (business logic & components)
- TypeScript type checking
- ESLint linting  
- Code formatting check
- **Test coverage reporting**
- Security dependency scan
- **Docker image build and push** (multi-platform)
- **SBOM generation**
- **Container security scanning**
- **Deployment notification**

**Result:** Complete pipeline with image published to DockerHub using PR tags.

### On Push to Main/Master

âœ… **Full Pipeline Runs:**

- **Unit tests with Jest** (business logic & components)
- All the same steps as PR above
- **Docker image build and push** (multi-platform)
- **SBOM generation**
- **Container security scanning**
- **Deployment notification**

**Result:** Complete pipeline with image published to DockerHub using main/latest tags.

## Image Tagging Strategy

### Pull Requests

- `pr-123` (for PR number 123)
- Images are **built and pushed** to DockerHub

### Main/Master Branch Pushes

- `latest` (latest version)
- `main-abc123` (branch + commit SHA)
- Images are **built and pushed** to DockerHub

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Complete Testing**: Full pipeline validation for every change
2. **Early Detection**: Catch all issues (build, security, publish) in PRs
3. **Consistent Process**: Same workflow for PRs and production
4. **Full Security**: Complete security scanning for all images
5. **SBOM Generation**: Software Bill of Materials for supply chain transparency

### Example Workflow Run

### PR Workflow

```text
1. âœ… Run Jest unit tests with coverage
2. âœ… TypeScript type checking
3. âœ… ESLint linting & Prettier formatting
4. âœ… Security dependency scan  
5. âœ… Build and push Docker image (AMD64/ARM64)
6. âœ… Generate SBOM
7. âœ… Security scan published image
8. âœ… Full deployment notification
```

### Main Branch Push Workflow

```text
1. âœ… Run Jest unit tests with coverage
2. âœ… TypeScript type checking
3. âœ… ESLint linting & Prettier formatting
4. âœ… Security dependency scan
5. âœ… Build and push Docker image
6. âœ… Generate SBOM
7. âœ… Security scan published image
8. âœ… Full deployment notification
```

## Quick Commands After Deployment

### Pull Latest Image

```bash
docker pull your-username/gigsy:latest
```

### Run Specific Version

```bash
docker pull your-username/gigsy:main-abc123
docker run -p 3000:3000 your-username/gigsy:main-abc123
```

### Local Development Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
pnpm test:coverage

# Build and test locally (same as CI)
docker build -t gigsy-test .
docker run -p 3000:3000 gigsy-test
```

## Test Coverage & Artifacts

The CI pipeline now generates and stores:

- **Test Coverage Reports** - Available as artifacts for 7 days
- **Jest Test Results** - Displayed in GitHub Actions summary
- **SBOM (Software Bill of Materials)** - Available for 30 days
- **Security Scan Results** - Integrated with GitHub Security tab

## Security Features

- âœ… **Dependency scanning** on every PR and push
- âœ… **Container security scanning** on all published images
- âœ… **SBOM generation** for supply chain transparency
- âœ… **Multi-platform builds** for broad compatibility
- âœ… **Complete pipeline validation** for both PRs and production

## Next Steps

1. **Create a PR** to test the full pipeline
2. **Verify** that it builds, scans, and publishes the Docker image
3. **Merge the PR** to see the production pipeline with latest tags
4. **Check DockerHub** - both PR and main images will be available

The workflow now runs the **complete full pipeline for both PRs and pushes**, giving you maximum confidence and thorough testing at every stage.
